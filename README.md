## Lab 1 - Introduction to QGIS Mapping  
**basic map: political reference map showing country and state boundaries**  
***files:*** [lab 1 qgis file](lab1.qgs), [lab 1 image](lab1.png)

## Lab 2 - Mapping US Population  
**two thematic mixed symbol maps (How is population geographically distributed across the United States?): map 1 - choropleth and proportional symbol, map 2 - choropleth and dot density**  
***files:*** [lab 2 qgis file](lab2.qgs), [map 1](lab2map1.png), [map 2](lab2map2.png)

## Lab 3 - Mapping the Use of SNAP benefits in Washington State  
**two choropleth maps mapping census and county data (What is the distribution of SNAP benefit use in Washington State?)**

## Lab 4 - Mapping Global Emissions  
**three maps with different map projections (Which countries have the largest carbon footprint? And how are carbon and other emissions distributed around the world?): map 1 - mixed symbols map of CO2 emissions - dot density and choropleth, map 2 - orthographic map of particulate matter concentrations, map 3 - mixed symbols map of cumulative CO2 emissions - proportional and choropleth**

## Lab 5 - Mapping Climate Change  
**map with both raster and vector data layers (How is climate change distributed across the US?)**

## Lab 6 - Racial Inequalities in Healthcare: Mapping Breast Cancer Mortality Rates by Race  
**two thematic maps (How are breast cancer mortality rates distributed geographically and by race?)**  
***files:*** [lab 6 qgis file](lab6.qgs), [US Breast Cancer Mortality Rates for Black Women vs White Women](lab6map1.png), [Breast Cancer Mortality Rates Compared to Black Population Size](lab6map2.png)

## Lab 7 - Analyzing Electoral Politics in King County  
**two maps made after conducting spatial and attribute queries and using overlays and buffers: map 1 - concentric buffers showing parts of King County within a certain distance from ballot dropboxes, map 2 - screenshot of Voting Districts intersected with Seattle City Council Districts, map 3 - dot density map with 1 mile buffer on top (How well distributed are the King County ballot dropboxes?)**
